# Introduction

Pedro Pathing is a Reactive Vector Follower designed by [FTC Team 10158](https://ftcscout.org/teams/10158?season=2023) to improve autonomous navigation. 

It uses Bézier curve generation to ensure smoother, faster, and more efficient pathing compared to traditional systems like RoadRunner.
