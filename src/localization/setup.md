# Setup your Localizer

---
## Define your localizer
1. Go to your class with a `static{}` block, where you will be changing your FollowerConstants (In the Quickstart, this class is called `FConstants`).
2. Once there, type this, where [LOCALIZER] is your localizer of choice:
```java 
FollowerConstants.localizers = Localizers.[LOCALIZER];
```

3. The default is THREE_WHEEL, you will not have to do this step if you are using three wheel, as it is the default.

Use this diagram to find the offset of your localizer. This view is from the top of the robot looking downwards

## Access
To begin setting up your localizer, go to your class with a `static{}` block, where you will be changing your Localizer's constants (In the Quickstart, this class is called `LConstants`).

From there, continue the steps for your localizer in the linked pages:
- [Drive Encoder Localizer](driveEncoder.md)
- [Two Wheel Localizer](twoWheel.md)
- [Three Wheel Localizer](threeWheel.md)
- [Three Wheel + IMU Localizer](threeWheelImu.md)
- [OTOS Localizer](otos.md)
- [Pinpoint Localizer](pinpoint.md)
