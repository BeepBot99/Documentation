# Forward Velocity Tuner

## Purpose

The **Forward Velocity Tuner** determines the velocity of your robot when moving forward at full power. This value is used for accurate path-following calculations in Pedro Pathing.

## Setup and Instructions

1. Open the `ForwardVelocityTuner.java` OpMode.
2. Ensure your robot has enough space to drive **40 inches** forward. You can adjust this distance in the FTC Dashboard under the `ForwardVelocityTuner` dropdown, but larger distances yield better results.
3. Run the OpMode.

## Output

* **Velocity**: After the robot has completed the distance, the final velocity will be displayed in telemetry.
* Note: The robot may drift slightly after completing the movement. Ensure the testing area has adequate space.

## Inputting the Results

1. Open the `FollowerConstants` class.
2. Replace the value of the `xMovement` variable on **line 33** with the velocity output from the tuner.

Congratulations, youâ€™ve completed the forward velocity tuning!
