# Introduction

Pedro Pathing is an **advanced Reactive Vector Follower** developed by [FTC Team 10158](https://ftcscout.org/teams/10158?season=2023) to revolutionize autonomous navigation in robotics. Unlike conventional pathing systems such as RoadRunner, Pedro Pathing leverages Bézier curve generation to produce smoother, faster, and more efficient trajectories. Its primary focus is on enhancing the adaptability of robots during autonomous operation by reacting dynamically to environmental changes, reducing error margins, and ensuring optimal path execution. 

By incorporating Bézier curves, the system provides:
- **Smoother Transitions:** Ensuring less jerky motions for precision-intensive tasks.
- **Faster Execution:** Reducing time spent in path planning and execution.
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** Reacting to obstacles or changes in the environment in real-time.

Pedro Pathing is tailored for teams looking to push the boundaries of autonomous efficiency and accuracy. Whether you’re a seasoned team or just getting started with autonomous systems, this documentation will guide you through setting up, tuning, and implementing Pedro Pathing in your projects.
